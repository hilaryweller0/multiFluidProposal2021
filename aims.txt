It should have three essential, minimum properties:

\begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item When convection is well resolved, the solutions are identical to a single fluid model.
\item When convection is fully sub-grid, the solutions are at least as accurate as a dynamical core with a conventional parameterisation.
\item When convection is partially resolved, the solutions are more accurate than a single-fluid model with no parameterisation and more accurate than the multi-fluid model at coarse resolution.
\end{enumerate}
