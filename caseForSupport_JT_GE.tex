The proposed project will require interdisciplinary expertise in atmospheric physics and fluid dynamics
and in the development of improved numerics and physical parameterisations for atmospheric models.
We have assembled a research team that has the necessary breadth and depth of expertise and is built on
existing strong collaborations.

{\color{red} I've shortened the section on JT a bit, but we'll need more trimming to fit in Dan and Will.}

\paragraph*{Dr Hilary Weller (Reading)} has been the lead PI on three NERC grants on atmospheric modelling, a PI on both phases of the Met Office/NERC/STFC UK Dynamical Core project ``Gung-Ho'', to design and build the next Met Office dynamical core and a Co-I on both phases of the NERC/Met Office Paracon projects to improve the modelling of convection in atmospheric models.

Dr Weller has had successful collaborations with Met Office staff, including creating and analysing long time step transport schemes \cite[]{CWPS17,SWMD17} and finding optimal coupling between fast and slow processes \cite[][]{WLW13}. She led pioneering work analysing numerical methods for quasi-uniform grids of the sphere \cite[e.g.][]{WWF09,Wel12,WTC12} and proposed improvements in modelling flow over orography \cite[]{WS14}. 

Before working on numerical methods, Dr Weller worked on tropical meteorology \cite[e.g.][]{LGWS09} which kindled her interest in atmospheric convection. She has combined her applied meteorology experience with her numerical modelling expertise, proposing, with Prof. Thuburn, the use of multi-fluid modelling for representing subgrid-scale convection \cite[]{TWV+18} and creating the first numerical method to solve these equations \cite[]{WM19}. \cite{WMS20} demonstrates a skillful representation of sub-grid dry convection using a multi-fluid model.

\paragraph*{Dr Georgios Efstathiou (Exeter)} is a NERC Independent Research Fellow working on grey-zone turbulence modelling. He has over 15 years of experience in research on the modelling of
atmospheric processes at various scales, from turbulent motions in the boundary layer
to heavy precipitation synoptic systems. An overarching theme is understanding the
connections between atmospheric scales with the aim to improve high-resolution
numerical weather prediction. He has conducted many Large Eddy Simulation (LES) studies and used LES to identify 
the characteristics of the boundary-layer grey zone \citep[e.g.][]{efstathiou2015}
and develop parameterisations suitable for sub-kilometre, very high-resolution models 
\citep{efstathiou2016}. One of his main contributions in grey zone 
studies was the extension of dynamic sub-grid models from the LES to the grey zone region 
providing adaptive and scale dependent turbulence length scales for sub-grid models 
\citep{efstathiou2018,efstathiou2019a}. As part of the NERC/Met Office ParaCon 
project he has developed a novel method to identify updrafts in convective flows 
by optimising the multi-fluid decomposition of the atmosphere \citep{ETB20}.

\paragraph*{Prof. John Thuburn (Exeter)} holds a Chair in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics at the University of Exeter, jointly
funded by the Met Office under the Met Office Academic Partnership.
Since 2000 he has collaborated closely with the Met Office on numerical methods for their
weather and climate models. He made important contributions to the development of the
ENDGame dynamical core \cite[e.g.][]{WSW+14}, which is now a major operational success.
% Could drop the next two sentences
Since 2011 he has collaborated with the Met Office and other UK academic partners on the ``Gung-Ho''
project to develop a future dynamical core suitable for massively parallel computer
architectures, \citep[e.g.][]{MBSWTC19}.
%An important theme is to capture key aspects of accuracy related to balance and
%conservation on non-traditional grids \cite[e.g.][]{TC15}.
%The coupling of physical parameterisations and subgrid models to resolved dynamics is often
%particularly subtle because the coupling occurs via marginally resolved and imperfectly
%represented scales.
%Prof.\ Thuburn has contributed to understanding these numerical aspects
%of physics-dynamics coupling in the context of quasi-two-dimensional turbulent cascades \cite[e.g.][]{TKW14} and %boundary layer parameterisations \cite[]{HTW13a}.
He has contributed to the emerging field of Physics-Dynamics Coupling for atmospheric models.
Most relevant for the present proposal is that,
together with co-authors, he developed the mathematical framework for the multi-fluid
approach \citep[][]{TWV+18}, analysed the conservation and normal mode properties
of the unparameterised multi-fluid equations \citep[][]{TV18}, and demonstrated
a proof of concept for a single-column model of the dry convective boundary-layer \citep[][]{TEB19}.

\section{Motivation and Summary}

The representation of subgrid-scale convection is arguably the weakest aspect of current weather and climate models, leading to unrealistic simulations of monsoons, the diurnal cycle of rainfall, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and convectively coupled waves  \cite[]{SAB+13,HPB+14}. The representation of the subgrid-scale flow becomes particularly challenging at resolutions where convection is partially resolved -- the grey zone -- as assumptions behind current schemes, such as horizontal homogeneity, are grossly violated \cite[e.g.][]{GG05}.

Standard convection schemes are based on a simplified representation of vertical fluxes in terms of a division of the sub-grid flow into separate, homogeneous flows such as updraft, downdraft and environment, with assumptions of small updraft area fraction and horizontally homogeneous quasi-equilbrium, implying no net mass flux and no horizontal transports or propagation. The multi-fluid approach removes these assumptions and has shown promise in single-column models. However it is as yet unproven in three-dimensional models and does not address sub-grid variability beyond the multi-fluid division. High-order (or multi-moment) turbulence modelling predicts moments of probability distributions of sub-grid variability. The multi-fluid and multi-moment approaches thus provide two different ways of accounting for sub-grid variability in models, each likely to be most useful in different regimes. Their unification has the potential to work well across a much wider range of regimes, in particular, enabling the construction of a scale-aware model that is applicable at a range of resolutions encompassing the turbulent and convective grey zones.

Our overarching aim is to advance the fundamental physics-based understanding of turbulent convection in order to develop a three-dimensional, multi-fluid, multi-moment model with a seamless transition from {\color{blue} fully subgrid, through the grey zone and to resolved convection}. We will proceed incrementally, building on existing models and developing improved or completely new parameterisations, gradually adding complexity to the model formulation and to the test cases simulated.
A multi-fluid model with a simplified multi-moment representation has already been shown to work well in a single column, so we will start by simulating fully sub-grid convection in three dimensions using similar parameterisations.
There is considerable scope to improve these parameterisations, {\color{blue} improvements and generalisations will certainly be needed to simulate partially resolved convection. 
To formulate these improvements we will use a variety of approaches, all ultimately founded on comprehensive diagnostics of high-resolution LES data to provide a `ground truth'.}
%{\color{red} NEEDS WORK To formulate these improved parameterisations, complete multi-fluid and multi-moment budgets will be diagnosed from high resolution LES and combined with a toolbox of methods.}
The new approach will be evaluated using a suite of equilibrium and non-equilibrium test cases of convective growth and propagation. A key deliverable will be an open source community model enabling the future research needed to develop the approach towards operational use.

%We will explore the sensitivity of the accuracy to the number of fluids versus the number of moments that are used and which moments should be diagnostic or prognostic (i.e. which level of the Mellor-Yamada hierarchy). We will need to find an appropriate turbulence length scale in a multi-fluid context.

%This proposal will describe a toolbox of methods for finding new closures. High resolution LES will be used to diagnose multi-fluid and multi-moment budgets and evaluate closures. 


\section{Scientific Background}

% I am trying to avoid implying that we `parameterise' convection in the multi-fluid context, because the
% leading order dynamics is meant to be captured by the dycore - this might lead to some convoluted wording
% below, but let's see... JT

%At coarse resolution, convection parameterisation is necessary because, without it, convection is forced to occur at the model grid scale resulting in highly unrealistic behaviour and instability \cite[]{PY15}.
%As supercomputers increase in size, convection is better resolved over larger areas \cite[e.g.][]{GC17} but fully resolving convection over the whole globe is for weather prediction is not likely to ever be achievable \cite[e.g.][]{SSJ+19} so parameterisation will always be needed. 
%Schemes such as mass flux convection remove this instability by re-distributing heat, moisture and momentum in the vertical but not mass \cite[]{Tied89,GR90}. Convection is assumed to be in equilibrium with the large scale so no account is taken of the gradual build-up of convection. Convection in one grid column is assumed to be independent of its neighbours and advection of convective systems is neglected. There have been valuable improvements such as relaxing the quasi-equilibrium assumption \cite[]{PR98,GG05,Par14} and adding stochasticity \cite[]{PC08} but due to the fundamental assumptions in convection parameterisation it has not been possible to create schemes that work well when convection is partially resolved.

Coarse resolution models must represent the effects of subgrid-scale convection, otherwise convection is forced to occur at the model grid scale resulting in highly unrealistic behaviour and possibly model instability \cite[]{PY15}.
As supercomputers increase in power, convection can be better resolved over larger areas \cite[e.g.][]{GC17}, but fully resolved convection is not likely to be achieved in the foreseeable future for global weather prediction or routine climate modelling \cite[e.g.][]{SSJ+19}; thus, there is an ongoing need to represent the effects of subgrid-scale convection.
Typical operational convection schemes are built on a set of simplifying approximations:
heat, moisture and momentum are re-distributed in the vertical, but not mass \cite[]{Tied89,GR90}; convection is assumed to be in equilibrium with the large scale so limited account is taken of convective memory and the gradual build-up of convection; convection in one grid column is assumed to be independent of its neighbours and advection of convective systems is neglected. These simplifying approximations are believed to limit the accuracy and physical fidelity of
convection in weather and climate models. Despite recent valuable improvements, such as relaxing the quasi-equilibrium assumption \cite[]{PR98,GG05,Par14} and adding stochasticity \cite[]{PC08}, it has not been possible to develop schemes that work well when convection is partially resolved.

\cite{TWV+18} proposed a new approach --- multi-fluid modelling of convection --- in which convective updrafts, downdrafts and the stable environment are modelled as distinct fluids with separate, but consistent, momentum, continuity, energy and moisture transport equations. The fluids interact via entrainment, detrainment and pressure terms. 
The leading-order dynamics of convection, including non-equilibrium effects, net mass transport, and other horizontal and vertical transports, is explicitly described by these equations, allowing them to be represented by
an extended numerical model dynamical core. Although some processes must still be parameterised, including entrainment,
detrainment, and small-scale turbulent fluxes, these are far fewer than with a traditional convection scheme.
The multi-fluid approach has similarities with the extended Eddy-Diffusivity Mass-Flux (EDMF) scheme of \cite{TKP+18} who added time derivatives to the EDMF equations.

%Multi-fluid modelling needs some of the same closures as mass-flux parameterisations, such as entrainment and detrainment, but it does away with trigger functions and cloud base mass fluxes, relying instead on the intrinsic dynamics of the multi-fluid equations to capture those processes.

%{\color{red} There have been other attempts to include net mass transport by convection \cite[]{KB08,MB19} by modifying existing models, but in a way that is unlikely to work in the grey zone since they do not have numerically stable coupling between the updraft velocity and the pressure.}

%{\color{red} The idea of two fluid partitions, each with simple univariate or bivariate Gaussian distributions of sub-grid variability, was used by \cite{GLC02} and forms the basis of the CLUBB parameterisation. However, specifying the parameters in such distributions requires knowledge of (or assumptions about) many high-order moments; multi-fluids each with first or second-order moment equations provides potentially a simpler but more powerful approach.}


% Much work on parameterising turbulence in the atmosphere has focused on the boundary layer. Most relevant to this project is the \citet{mellor1973,mellor1974,mellor1982} MY hierarchy of turbulence closure models. The continuous governing equations were ensemble averaged and manipulated to obtain prognostic equations for all second-order moments such as turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and subgrid-scale heat fluxes.


Mass flux convection schemes focus on representing the transport due to subgrid-scale coherent structures such as
updrafts. An alternative approach to representing subgrid-scale transports is to solve prognostic or diagnostic
equations for a range of second-order moments. This multi-moment approach is most commonly used for the
boundary layer, and is exemplified by the \citet{mellor1973,mellor1974,mellor1982} MY hierarchy of turbulence
closure models.
There are several reasons for expecting a unification of the multi-fluid and multi-moment approaches to enable
significant advances. It would avoid an artificial separation of boundary layer and convection schemes.
It would enable multi-moment information to be used in the multi-fluid parameterised terms, particularly
entrainment and detrainment. It would enable a more physically based parameterisation of sub-grid turbulent
fluxes, including, for example, upgradient fluxes such as those due to the fallback of thermals
overshooting the boundary layer inversion. Most importantly, it would provide a framework
with the potential to work smoothly across the grey zone from fully resolved to fully sub-grid convection.

We have derived the governing equations for the multi-fluid analogue of the MY hierarchy, but there remain
some key questions, which we aim to investigate. Which combination of multiple fluids and multiple moments
most efficiently describes the sub-grid processes, and does the answer depend on flow regime or model resolution?
How can multi-moment information be best used to inform multi-fluid entrainment and detrainment terms?
How must tuneable coefficients in the MY system, e.g.\ in defining {\color{blue} the unresolved} turbulent length scales, be modified
for the multi-fluid case {\color{blue} and what is their resolution dependence across the scales (e.g. in the grey zone)? } 

Existing parameterisations of entrainment and detainment, and eddy diffusive representation of small-scale turbulent
fluxes, will provide a valuable starting point for the proposed work, and we have had some success with them in
single column models. However, further work is needed to adapt these parameterisations for three-dimensional models,
and especially to formulate the gridscale-dependence that will enable them to work seamlessly across the grey zone.
Discovering quantitatively and causally correct parameterisations is difficult when processes are complex, as in moist
convection. Our approach will be to build upon existing parameterisations, incorporating physical and fluid dynamical
understanding, and extending them, for example, using Assumed PDFs (APDFs) and the theory of distributions, incorporating
multi-moment information where appropriate. Important physical and mathematical constraints on the formulation will
be taken into account. Vital to this work will be detailed diagnostics of LES data to validate proposed formulations
and to motivate new ones.

% A particular focus will be on validating not just the the final answer but the proposed mechanism.


%Traditionally, progress has been made by combining physical and fluid dynamical understanding with
%analysis of detailed process models [and this will remain our primary approach?]. 
%Now, however, automated techniques for discovering relationships in the data are rapidly advancing, and 
%there are terabytes of convection resolving simulations available. Machine learning with neural networks may be able to discover processes from high resolution data that have not been observed \cite[e.g.][]{ogorman2018}. However, due to their lack of physical basis, neural networks may not be able to extrapolate beyond the range of their training data to new situations such as global warming. An alternative, which enables finding closed-form parameterisations, is the relevance vector machine \cite[e.g.][]{tipping2001}. This uses a sparse Bayesian regression to discover which combination of resolved variables best reproduces a desired subgrid term diagnosed from a high-resolution simulation. This results in a directly interpretable parameterisation and has been used to suggest a successful scale-aware parameterisation for ocean mesoscale eddies \cite[]{zanna2020}.


\section{Outline Formulation of Multi-fluid Modelling of Convection}
\label{sec:mf}

To provide more background to the proposed research we present here the
multi-fluid, dry Boussinesq Navier-Stokes equations \cite[approximated by][]{WMS20} (though the model to be developed will, in fact,
be anelastic) {\color{red} which of the several flavours of anelastic?}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial\sigma_{i}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\sigma_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i}) & = & {\textstyle\sum}_{j\ne i}\left\{ M_{ji}-M{}_{ij}\right\} ,\label{eq:sigma}\\
\frac{D_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i}}{Dt}+\nabla P_{i} & = & b_{i}\mathbf{k}+\nabla\cdot \mathsf{T}_i +\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}}{\textstyle\sum}_{j\ne i}\left\{ M_{ji}\left(\mathbf{u}_{ji}^{T}-\mathbf{u}_{i}\right)-M_{ij}\left(\mathbf{u}_{ij}^{T}-\mathbf{u}_{i}\right)\right\} , \label{eq:mom}\\
\frac{D_{i}b_{i}}{Dt} & = & -\nabla\cdot \mathbf{F}^b_{i} +\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}}{\textstyle\sum}_{j\ne i}\left\{ M_{ji}\left(b_{ji}^{T}-b_{i}\right)-M_{ij}\left(b_{ij}^{T}-b_{i}\right)\right\} , \label{eq:b}\\
{\textstyle\sum}_{i}\nabla\cdot\sigma_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i} & = & 0 , \label{eq:divFree}\\
{\textstyle\sum}_{i}\sigma_{i} & = & 1.\label{eq:sumOne}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\sigma_i$, $\mathbf{u}_i$, $b_i$ and $P_i$ are the volume fraction, velocity, buoyancy and pressure of fluid $i$. Representing moist convection also needs transport equations for moisture in each fluid and a latent heating term in the buoyancy equation. $M_{ij}$ is the mass transfer rate from fluid $i$ to $j$, representing entrainment and detrainment. $\mathbf{u}_{ij}^T$ is the mean velocity of the fluid that is transferred from $i$ to $j$ and $b_{ij}^T$ is the mean buoyancy of the fluid that is transferred. 
$\mathsf{T}_i$ is the stress tensor and $\mathbf{F}^b_{i}$ the buoyancy flux that arise because of subgrid-scale inhomogeneity.
Additional equations are needed if we wish to diagnose or predict higher-order moments.

These multi-fluid equations can represent subgrid-scale convection if, for example, fluid 0 is the stable environment, fluid 1 is updrafts and fluid 2 is downdrafts. The equations are derived from the standard Boussinesq equations by partitioning the fluid into these different types, according to some criteria, and then averaging to a coarser scale such as the model grid scale---this is conditional averaging. The same conditional averaging approach is used to diagnose multi-fluid budgets from high-resolution data; such `ground truth' data will be critical for developing and validating the multi-fluid model.
Although the concepts of updraft and downdraft seem intuitive, there are no universally accepted criteria defining them. We have found criteria based on optimising resolved fluxes \cite[]{ETB20} to be very useful in our work to date.


% I don't want to talk about initialization - in practice we would not do it that way
%In order to initialise a multi-fluid model, high resolution data must be partitioned into separate fluids and then averaged onto the (coarser) model grid---this is conditional averaging. The same approach is needed to evaluate the multi-fluid model and to diagnose subgrid-scale fluxes from high resolution data. Techniques such as the optimisation of resolved fluxes \cite[]{ETB20} can be used to define the fluid partitions for the conditional averaging.

For the multi-fluid equations to represent subgrid-scale convection, several terms in \eqref{eq:sigma}-\eqref{eq:sumOne} must be parameterised:
\begin{itemize}
\item rates of mass transfer between fluids, $M_{ij}$, to represent entrainment and detrainment;
\item the properties of the transferred fluid, buoyancy $b_{ij}^T$, moisture $q_{ij}^T$, and momentum $\mathbf{u}_{ij}^T$; 
\item pressure differences between fluids (the mean pressure is determined by incompressibility \eqref{eq:divFree});
\item subgrid-scale fluxes for each fluid, $\mathsf{T}_i$, $\mathbf{F}^b_{i}$, and the corresponding moisture fluxes $\mathbf{F}^q_{i}$.
\end{itemize}

As a starting point, subgrid-scale fluxes can be parametrised as down-gradient diffusion with simple formulations for the turbulent diffusivities,
while the properties of transferred fluid can be modelled in terms of the mean properties of fluids~$i$ and~$j$. 
However, we have found improved results in our single-column model by allowing the turbulent diffusivities to depend upon predicted turbulent
kinetic energies, and by allowing the properties of transferred fluid to depend upon estimates of the sub-grid variances of moisture and vertical velocity.
These results motivate us to pursue the development of a more complete multi-moment, multi-fluid model.


%{\color{red} [This is repeating stuff that is now said elsewhere.]
%Closures such as entrainment and detrainment rates and turbulent diffusivities from conventional parameterisations can be used with the multi-fluid equations. Complete closure sets specific to multi-fluid modelling have been developed \cite[]{WMS20,TEB19} and proved successful in single-column modelling. We therefore have good starting points for closing the multi-fluid equations but none have yet been shown to work in three dimensions or in the grey zone. }


\section{Relationship with ParaCon}

The poor state of convection parameterisation was the motivation for the \pounds 10M joint NERC, Met Office ParaCon project, which aims to make a ``step change in our ability to predict weather and climate impacts'' by improving parameterisation suitable for existing dynamical cores. The proposed project will utilise and advance some ParaCon outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The flexible convection parameterisation scheme CoMorph has been developed for use with the Met Office Unified Model (UM). CoMorph includes new closures for entrainment and detrainment.

\item The MONC LES model was developed and used to produce simulations of convection archetypes. Simulations of the dry and moist convective boundary layer, BOMEX shallow cumuli over the tropical ocean \cite[]{HR73}, radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), diurnal cycles of deep convection, the shallow cumulus ARM case \cite[]{BCC+02} and the transition from shallow to deep LBA case \cite[]{BFGB02} are available at multiple resolutions.

\item A method of partitioning the atmosphere into coherent thermal structures and their environment was developed \cite[]{ETB20} based on maximising the resolved transport captured by the mean fluid velocities and other properties, thereby minimising the unresolved contributions that need to parameterised.

\item The Mellor-Yamada closures have been extended to the grey zone and implemented in the UM.

\item A moist, two-fluid, single column model was developed using a variety of entrainment/detrainment closures dependent on turbulent kinetic energy, vertical velocity convergence and atmospheric instability. The model is able to reproduce many features of the ARM case \cite[]{BCC+02}, including updraft area fraction ($\sigma_1$) {\color{red} axis label says $\sigma_2$} and cloud properties (Fig \ref{fig:clouds}). 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{exeterScm.png}
\caption{Example results from a multi-fluid single-column model for the ARM test case. Left: the updraft fraction from the large eddy simulation (solid) and the two-fluid single-column model (dashed) at nine hours. Right: The cloud base (black) and cloud top (blue); large eddy simulation (solid) and two-fluid (dashed).}
\label{fig:clouds}
\end{figure}

\item A multi-fluid analogue of the Mellor-Yamada hierarchy was derived including second-moment equations for each fluid type. All of the terms in the original Mellor-Yamada formulation have analogues in the multi-fluid version. There are new terms accounting for transfers between fluids (i.e.\ entrainment and detrainment) and  terms that account for subgrid-scale pressure fluctuations.


\item
{\color{red} This makes it sound like job done. See also John M's comment. Is MultiFluidAtmosFOAM fully compressible? (I can't remember.) Or is fully compressible referring to the SCM?
Fully compressible multi-fluid models with simplified moist physics were developed. MultiFluidAtmosFOAM is a three-dimensional model written using the flexible, parallel modelling framework OpenFOAM, enabling focus on the equations and algorithms rather than the spatial discretisation. }

\end{enumerate}

The multi-fluid approach is not a conventional stand-alone parameterisation that can be called from an existing dynamical core; in contrast to the traditional distinction between `dynamics' and parameterised `physics', it
treats the leading-order dynamics of convection as part of the `dynamics'. Consequently,
it requires a bottom-up re-development of the model formulation. For this reason, the development of the multi-fluid approach was always expected to extend beyond the end of ParaCon. In this project we will build on the progress made under ParaCon in developing both the multi-fluid approach (basic formulation, stable numerical solutions, sub-grid closures, and single column demonstrations) and the multi-moment turbulence approach by bringing them together.

\section{Proposed Research}

\subsection{Objectives}

Our overarching aim is to carry out underpinning research in turbulent convection in order to develop a three-dimensional multi-fluid model that can accurately simulate convection across a range of convection-resolving to subgrid-convection resolutions. {\color{red} It should have three essential, minimum properties:

\begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\alph{enumi}}
\item When convection is well resolved, the solutions are identical to a single fluid model.
\item When convection is fully sub-grid, the solutions are at least as accurate as a dynamical core with a conventional parameterisation.
\item When convection is partially resolved, the solutions are more accurate than a single-fluid model with no parameterisation and more accurate than the multi-fluid model at coarse resolution.
\end{enumerate}

These are fine objectives. But they could easily become rods for our backs. And it would be a lot of work to set up the extra infrastructure needed to do the clean comparisons needed to test each one. }


We plan to meet this aim via the following specific objectives:

% {\color{red} Should these objectives match up with the work packages? They half do. Also, it feels like there's a
% bit of an artificial separation between single moment and multi-moment, and between development and evaluation. }
{\color{red} There's a mismatch between objective 6 and WP7.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{it:model} Develop the software framework for a flexible, three-dimensional, multi-fluid, multi-moment model of the atmosphere including three phases of moisture. %This objective does not include finding optimal closures.

\item\label{it:budgets} Calculate comprehensive detailed diagnostics from LES data to inform the model development and for validation.

% budgets of subgrid-scale fluxes from LES data in order to diagnose the values of entrainment and detrainment and other closures.

\item Using the the approaches described in section \ref{sec:tools}, develop and test suitable closures so that the single-moment, multi-fluid model simulates under-resolved dry and moist convection using simple models of turbulent fluxes.

\item Implement options for prognostic and diagnostic equations for higher-order moments in the multi-fluid model. Again using the the approaches of section \ref{sec:tools}, optimise turbulent length scales and dissipation rates, and develop and test suitable parameterisations for coupling of higher moments to transfer terms.

% Combine multi-fluid and Mellor-Yamada modelling to develop a  multi-fluid, multi-moment model for turbulent convection including consistent interactions between moments and fluids and closures for unknown correlations between moments.

\item Investigate which combination of multiple fluids and multiple moments most efficiently captures subgrid-scale
variability and transport for different types of convection and at different resolutions.

\item Evaluate using a hierarchy of convective cases from the Paracon project.

\item Deliver an open access, well documented, parallel, multi-fluid model of the atmosphere with well documented {\color{red} repetition} performance at representing convection across scales.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Work Packages}
\label{sec:WPs}

\workPackage{Flexible Modelling Framework (Reading, 6 months) \label{WP:model0}}

Using the OpenFOAM flexible modelling framework and building on the code developed during Paracon, we will develop multiFluidAtmosFOAM, a three-dimensional multi-fluid, multi-moment, anelastic model including moisture and some simple transfer terms and closures. This work will involve software testing and testing of exact properties such as conservation but will not aim to represent convection accurately. Combining code from Reading and Exeter will enable us to benchmark against the existing codes. All code will be version controlled and uploaded to a public \url{github.com} repository. A model description paper will be submitted to Geoscientific Model Development. This model will be suitable for carrying out the research in the rest of the project. 

% JT I'm not sure we need this?
% Some of the multi-fluid code developed during Paracon was fully compressible and some was Boussinesq. We do not need to include the complexities of full compressibility in multiFluidAtmosFOAM as this is not central to convection and the LES model that we are comparing with is anelastic. 

\workPackage{LES diagnostics (Exeter, 9 months) \label{WP:LESbudgets}}

We will compute detailed diagnostics on the LES of dry and moist convection cases produced during ParaCon, including complete budgets for all first- and second-moment quantities, pressure differences between fluids, turbulent length scales, and sub-grid PDFs, for the cases of a single fluid, two fluids (updraft and environment), and, for LBA, three fluids (updraft, downdraft, and environment).
We will decompose the flow into updrafts and their environment using the optimal decomposition developed during Paracon and extend this to diagnose coherent downdrafts. The budgets will be calculated for a range of horizontal filter scales, from a global horizontal average down to scales comparable to the cloud width and boundary layer depth.

%From the LES we can calculate the size but not the form of the closures. PDFs too...

An important aspect of our approach is to find closures within the simplest possible framework to avoid multiple competing influences contaminating the results. Hence we will ensure that the entrainment and detrainment and pressure differences between fluids are correctly modelled for dry convection first (using the approach of section \ref{sec:tools}).

We will simulate the dry convective boundary layer (CBL) with two fluids and using the same turbulent fluxes as were effective in the single column framework (Fig \ref{fig:clouds}). {\color{red} Note this means we're already in multi-moment territory. Or do you want to use specified diffusivity profiles (and not reference Fig~1)?} We will evaluate and develop closures first in the fully parameterised regime and then extend these to different resolutions through the grey-zone.

\workPackage{Multi-fluid modelling of moist convection (Reading, 9 months) \label{WP:moistMF}}

We will add three phases of water with simple microphysics and explore to what extent we can parameterise shallow and deep convection cases from the hierarchy with two or three fluids but with existing models of turbulent fluxes. Closures will be sought that that work through the grey zone with the limiting cases of fully sub-grid and fully resolved convection.

\workPackage{Multi-moment, multi-fluid modelling of dry convection (Exeter, 9 months) \label{WP:YMdry}}

The different levels of closure model proposed by Mellor and Yamada are based on neglecting transience, advection, and third-order turbulent transport in various second-moment equations. Using the budgets calculated in \ref{WP:LESbudgets}, we will test the validity of making analogous approximations for different numbers of fluids and for different filter scales in the boundary layer. The diagnosed distributions of third-order terms, pressure-correlation terms, and dissipation terms will be compared with the models proposed by Mellor and Yamada (and subsequent authors). The turbulent length scales required to optimise the multi-fluid Mellor-Yamada scheme will be compared for different filter scales and different numbers of fluids, paying particular attention to the grey zone. We anticipate that these length scales {\color{green} may be related to the spatial extent of the different fluid structures}, but there is currently no theory available. We will also use the information provided by the moments to better parameterise entrainment and detrainment using the approaches discussed in section~\ref{sec:tools}.

%the toolbox (below).

\workPackage{Multi-moment, multi-fluid modelling of moist convection (Exeter, 12 months) \label{WP:YMmoist}}

Building on the LES simulations and the single-column, multi-fluid, multi-moment simulation of the ARM test case (see Fig \ref{fig:clouds}), we will simulate this test case with the three-dimensional multi-fluid, multi-moment model at coarse resolution with the same closures as the single-column model.  We will next increase the resolution into the grey zone, where existing parameterisations may not work so well. We will explore whether additional moments or a third fluid are needed in order to best represent the sinking of overshooting thermals. 

We will simulate a radiative-convective equilibrium case without aggregation and compare with Paracon LES data. An ability to simulate the same horizontal mean equilibrium state at a range of resolutions across the grey zone will be a critical test of the scale-awareness of the multi-moment multi-fluid approach.



% We will check that the equilibrium conditions are not sensitive to modelling assumptions about the initial conditions and are not resolution dependent through the grey zone.


\workPackage{Evaluation \label{WP:evaluate} (Exeter, 6 months, Reading, 9 months)}

The evaluation will use a different test case with different forcings in order to test if the new model is predictive rather than a fit to LES. This will consist of a squall line over flat terrain \cite[]{FM06}. In order to test if we are doing better than a state of the art conventional parameterisation, we will compare with the idealised Met Office UM model using the CoMorph parameterisation at coarse resolution using the same simplified microphysics. Squall lines are known to be challenging for standard convection parameterisations \cite[e.g.][]{LCD+08} due to the lack of propagation of convection and the lack of mass transport by convection. We will evaluate sensitivity to resolution through the grey zone. 

We will compare different versions of multiFluidAtmosFOAM with different closures, different numbers of fluids and different moments in order to find how many terms and how many prognostic equations need to be retained. 

\workPackage{A community turbulent multi-fluids model \label{WP:model} (Reading, 6 months)}

MultiFluidAtmosFOAM will be developed throughout the project. The final version will:
\begin{enumerate}
\item solve for one, two or three fluids;
\item include options for predicting or diagnosing the standard set of second moments within each fluid;
\item use Cartesian geometry and no orography;
\item include simplified radiation and moist physics, a simplified bottom boundary and no stratosphere;
\item be parallelised using MPI.
\end{enumerate}
We will create documentation and a set of test cases for new users to run. A part II model description paper will be submitted to Geoscientific Model Development.



%\subsection{Tools for Finding and Evaluating Closures}
\subsection{Formulating and evaluating parameterisations}
\label{sec:tools}



%{\color{red} For me the top of the list would still be the traditional approach of fluid-dynamical understanding
%(and physical and mathematical consistency) plus hi-res process modelling to formulate as well as tune
%parameterisations. But I guess this includes several of the items below...}

{\color{red} I'm not keen on `tools' and `toolkit' here: makes it sound very mechanical, which it
most certainly isn't.}

{\color{red} We are trying to say that research is needed, but also that good candidates exist so it's low risk. Need to nuance this a bit.}


As discussed above, several terms in the multi-fluid equations, and their multi-moment extensions, need to be parameterised, but discovering suitable parameterisations is far from trivial because of the complexity of the problem.
For convection that is fully subgrid-scale, formulations of parameterised terms used in current mass flux and EDMF schemes as well as our own multi-fluid SCM will provide a good starting point and mitigate much of the risk in the project. Improvements to these formulations are clearly possible, for example by making use of multi-moment information, and novel formulations will certainly be needed for partially resolved convection. We will combine a variety of approaches to improve parameterisations and develop new ones, paying particular attention to developing scale-aware parameterisations that are valid across resolutions.

% Good candidates exist for closing the multi-fluid, multi-moment equations. The success of this project does not rely completely on finding new closures since the multi-fluid framework may prove beneficial even with existing closures. We have a toolkit for evaluating closures and finding new ones. We will pay particular attention to how relationships between sub-grid terms and resolved variables vary across scales. 


\subsubsection*{Optimisation of Existing Closures}

Taking LES data as `ground truth', we will calculate the parameters that optimise existing closures. If optimised parameter values vary only a little between test cases then existing closures may be sufficient.

\subsubsection*{Assumed Multi-fluid Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)}

Sub-grid PDFs of fluid properties affect grid-scale properties such as turbulent fluxes, cloud fraction, and buoyancy. It is expected that parameterisations of entrainment/detrainment based on assumed sub-grid PDFs can improve on current schemes; this approach was explored in the PhD thesis \cite{McIn20} supervised by Weller. Candidate assumed PDFs, and their relation to predicted or diagnosed variances and covariances, will be tested against LES data.
How the width of sub-grid PDFs varies with model resolution is likely to be crucial for a scale-aware formulation.

% Fluid properties can be represented as bi-or tri-Gaussians using the mean and variance of each fluid. From these it is possible to calculate the mass of fluid that crosses a threshold that defines the fluids. This implies a mass transfer (similar to transferring the tails of the distribution). The mean properties of the fluid transferred can also be calculated from the distribution. This approach was explored in the PhD thesis \cite{McIn20} supervised by Weller.

\subsubsection*{Theory of Distributions {\color{red} I think this could be shortened a bit?}}

Derivations of multi-fluid equations make use of discontinuous functions to label different regions of the underlying fluid \cite[]{Dopa77,TWV+18}. The terms requiring closure in such an approach depend on derivatives of those discontinuous functions. The theory of distributions (or generalised functions) \cite[]{Schw08} allows for the definition and manipulation of such discontinuous functions and their derivatives. This can be used to derive exact integral expressions for the terms requiring closure. Once conditions are specified to split the flow into multiple fluids, these conditions can be used to compute the closures directly from LES data. We will also use this method to suggest closures by considering simplified flows, and asymptotic approximations of evolution equations. For instance, the integrals can be calculated analytically for the first normal mode of Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection  \cite[]{SWCM2x}. This will lead to new physically-based closures for the entrainment and detrainment terms in a multi-fluid model. 

\subsubsection*{Physical and mathematical consistency}
%\subsubsection*{Asymptotics}

Closures should satisfy several basic physical and mathematical constraints:
(i)~term-by-term Galilean invariance;
(ii)~two initially identical fluids should remain identical when mixed;
(iii)~for any linear term of the multi-fluid equations, summing over all fluids should lead to the equivalent term of the original single-fluid equations;
(iv)~when convection is fully resolved, two fluids should evolve as one;
(v)~closures and numerical methods should not create energy and should conserve first moments of primitive variables;
(vi)~closures and numerical methods should not create new extrema except as a consequence of an assumed sub-grid PDF---numerical methods to ensure (v) and (vi) were derived by \cite{MWH20};
%\item At coarse resolution, a two-fluid model should be more accurate than a single-fluid model at the same resolution. By more accurate we mean that conditional averages are closer to a fully resolved single-fluid model.
(vii) an initially empty fluid should not influence a non-empty fluid.
Existing convection parameterisations do not have these properties, which can lead to spurious solutions in the grey zone.


%Candidate closures will be used to simulate various idealised test cases and we will demand:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Term-by-term Galilean invariance.
%\item Two initially identical fluids should remain identical when mixed.
%\item For any linear term of the multi-fluid equations, summing over all fluids should lead to the equivalent term of the original single-fluid equations.
%\item  When convection is fully resolved, two fluids should evolve as one.
%\item\label{it:energyTransfer} Closures and numerical methods should not create energy and not create or destroy first moments of primitive variables.
%\item\label{it:boundedTransfer} Closures and numerical methods should not create new extrema except where second-order moments provide sources for first-order moments.  Numerical methods to ensure \ref{it:energyTransfer} and \ref{it:boundedTransfer} were derived by \cite{MWH20}.
%\item At coarse resolution, a two-fluid model should be more accurate than a single-fluid model at the same resolution. By more accurate we mean that conditional averages are closer to a fully resolved single-fluid model.
%\item An initially empty fluid should not influence a non-empty fluid.
%\end{enumerate}
% Existing convection parameterisations do not have these properties, which can lead to spurious solutions in the grey zone.

% Once a set of closures obeys the above constraints, we will evaluate by developing coarse resolution multi-fluid models of LES convection cases developed during Paracon. These will increase in complexity in order to maintain an unambiguous link between additional complexity and model fidelity. They will start as single column, then fully parameterised coarse resolution and finally partially resolved (grey zone). 


\subsubsection*{Validation of assumed mechanisms}

We will validate against LES data not just the model's primary output variables but also subsidiary fields involved in the assumed physical mechanisms at play, such as turbulence length scales, sub-grid PDFs, and profiles of transferred fluid properties. This detailed validation of mechanisms will give us confidence that any right answers are obtained for the right reason rather than by compensating errors.



%\subsubsection*{The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM)}

%From the analysis of the LES (\ref{WP:LESbudgets} above) we will be able to calculate exactly the size but not the form of the closure needed to produce correct multi-fluid results. To apply the RVM we will also create a library of resolved variables which the specified subgrid term is conjectured to depend on. The RVM can then be used to discover which combination of resolved variables best reproduces the subgrid terms. This would provide physical insight into how the coherent structures of convection act, and to what extent that interaction can be universally represented.

\section{Potentials for Impact}

{\color{red} This section and the next are brief and weak.}

If we are able to show that multiFluidAtmosFOAM can represent convection more accurately than single-fluid models for a similar computational cost, then multiFluidAtmosFOAM can be further developed to create a more complete model that can be used for weather and climate prediction.

Earlier opportunities for impact will come from our data analysis. The closures that we develop for the multi-fluid equations are likely to be useful for other parameterisations of convection. Collaboration with the Met Office will ensure that useful developments see early operational use. 

\section{Management and Collaboration}

We plan to work as one team across both institutions and will meet together online once a week. Meetings with Met Office will be held four times a year to discuss project progress and plans and to co-ordinate evaluation, comparing with the idealised UM (see letter of support from the Met Office). Insights gained during this project will feed into the Met Office model development.

\section{Risks and Mitigations}

Some of the risks associated with this proposal are generic to modelling: slow code development and uncertainties in the results. These risks are mitigated by the experience of the investigators and researchers and by the flexible and advanced code that has already been developed.

There are some dependencies between work packages; the development and evaluation of closures relies on the LES analysis. However the theoretical work and the single-moment, multi-fluid model development can proceed without the results of the LES analysis. The evaluation relies on the model development work packages.

Multi-fluid modelling cannot be retro-fitted to an existing model as is usually done with convection parameterisations. This means that a whole new model is needed in order to produce a multi-fluid model of convection. This is a big undertaking for operational centres so the biggest risk is that multi-fluid modelling will not be adopted by big modelling centres. {\color{green} Therefore, the proposed project is a necessary first step before any attempt to fully implement the novel multi-fluid approach in an operational setting. We also plan} to create models with enough functionality to be useful for independent research into convection and parameterisation.

\section{Reviewers' comments. red = to do; {\color{blue} blue = done or OK}}

{\color{blue}
Reviewer 1 – Paul Williams

I am pleased to see new results from recent work at Exeter included in the revised CFS.  It is also good news that the Met Office have asked for more frequent meetings, so that this team's work can feed into their future parameterisations, and that the Met Office will articulate this in their letter of support.  Also, more emphasis has been put on the team's expertise (including that of NERC IRF George Efstathiou), which is helpful.  These three improvements all help to re-risk the proposal, moving it from "high risk, high reward" to (I would suggest) something like "medium risk, high reward".
}

There are two areas that I think would most benefit from attention: 

{\color{blue}
1) The (small) machine learning aspect has been retained, without bringing in relevant expertise.  But we know from RES that reviewers are often critical of (what might come across as) tokenistic machine-learning components, suggesting that the proposers have a lack of understanding of the techniques/tools/pitfalls.  Given that ML is only one of several tools that will be used in this part of the project, I would suggest that ML perhaps adds more to the risk side than the reward.  In a world where the slightest negative reviewer comment can make all the difference, I think it might be best to fully de-risk this part by dropping the ML aspect (even if the team plans to do it anyway if they win the grant!)
}

2) There is (I think) only one mention of computational cost (in Section 6: "If we are able to show that multiFluidAtmosFOAM can represent convection more accurately than single-fluid models for a similar computational cost ...").  This sentence raises the question: what if you can't, i.e. what if the computational cost is increased?  Is it possible to confront this head-on by inserting an explicit explanation of why any increased computational cost (if it occurs) is better spent on the multi-fluids approach rather than on a simple resolution increase in a single-fluid model? 

{\color{blue}
Minor gripes: 

EDMF doesn't seem to be defined.} 

{\color{blue} Perhaps "We will need to find an appropriate turbulence length scale" could be more confidently phrased ("We will find..."). }

{\color{blue} Perhaps better to state the source for Figure 1 in the caption. }

Summary comments 
 
It is a great proposal and a strong team. My comments here mainly relate to small changes that might help highlight or clarify some aspects for members of the panel who are not experts in numerical methods or model development. I think it will be in the mix of the proposals that the panel will discuss for ranking, so this is where you need to appeal to the whole panel because they need to rank a whole set of excellent proposals all scoring 8 or 9 and only some of the 9s will be funded. 

You have a very clear purpose, overarching goal and output. It seems achievable and the team has excellent combination of expertise and track record.} Now you need to sell advances in convection modelling versus anything else that is in scope for Panel B.  

Finally, you name William McIntyre and Dan Shipley in the Part 1 title, but they are not mentioned in the track record, other than through publications. Also, they are not mentioned by name in Part 2, although in risks section you do mention “investigators and researchers”. Do you intend that Will and Dan are researcher co-Is? Or will you try open recruitment for the two posts in Reading and Exeter? If they are researcher co-Is you should say so in Part 1 and also use this as a major risk mitigating factor in section 8. 
 
Detailed comments 

This is the first time I have seen this proposal – now in full proposal form. It is an excellent proposal, but there are probably a few places where the value of the research proposed can be made more obvious to a non-expert on the panel. This is important at the ranking stage, especially with even some grade 9s not being funded. 

{\color{blue}
On p.3 (motivation) it is very clear that the main output of the proposed work aims to be a 3-D multi-fluid, multi-moment model of convection. You focus on the tools and novel methods for model development which is appropriate. However, again appealing to the broader expertise of the panel, you might want to explicitly write down the breadth of different expertise that is being used here. i.e., LES simulations as “nature runs” or numerical laboratory, new mathematical physics development, novel numerical methods and model development. The complementarity of expertise in the team comes across later to some extent with the WPs – the model development being led by Reading and the evaluation of physics/dynamics being led at Exeter. At least this is my impression, but if it is not correct} you might want to address the focus of team members and what they bring explicitly. 

{\color{blue}
As mentioned by one of the previous reviewers, the machine learning aspect reads as a bit of an add on in section 2 and section 5. Maybe worth a slight expansion to integrate this part? My understanding of the approach proposed (as with Zanna et al) is that the equation set is physically based but the importance of different terms is unknown for the type of solutions sought. The ML determines which set of terms and level of turbulence closure to retain in the model. So, it fits in neatly with the multi-moment part. It is not as though unsupervised statistics-based ML is going to replace the physical model. The reason I mention this is again for the non-expert members on the panel and to address the more naïve question, “why spend all this effort developing a model with new physical formulation if it could all be replaced by machine learning?”. You don’t want to shoot yourself in the foot with this last paragraph of section 2. }

{\color{blue}
A question which popped up in my mind relates to the partition of pressure in the fluid components. It seems odd that each fluid has its own pressure. Is there some form of Dalton’s law for the partial pressures? The relationships between the $P_i$ are not described in the equation set or text. }

{\color{blue}
Section 3 – the last sentence is the key point, distinguishing the proposed work from the progress so far. }

{\color{blue}
Section 5 – the overarching objective is very clear throughout the proposal which is one of its key strengths. However, I would recommend getting across (before the detailed objectives) that the research proposed is also advancing the fundamental physics-based understanding of turbulent convection. i.e., you are not creating a numerical model in a context where the physical formulation is already complete (from ParaCon etc). }

{\color{blue}
Work packages. I assume that WP2 is talking about dry convection? Seems to make sense with modelling dry convection in 3-d before bringing in the moisture. }

{\color{blue}
WP3 – How will the pressure differences between fluids be evaluated? }

WP4: This is the step when water in vapour, liquid and ice phase first comes in? You don’t mention shallow and deep convection. You intend to use experiment setups for subtropical shallow cumulus (well studied observationally and with CRMs) and tropical deep convection? This short detail might appeal to a convection expert reviewer. 

{\color{blue}
WP5: What is the physical basis for the length scales required to optimize M-Y scheme? }

WP7: Squall lines – key element here is shear environment for convection. All experiments up to here without shear? There are some constraints associated with circulation in shear environment. 

WP8, item 4: By “no stratosphere” you are referring to rigid lid upper BC? 

5.3. New tools 

{\color{blue}
Make a stronger connection back to section 2 –  “relevance vector machine” is a tool stemming from machine learning community, but with direct applicability to turbulence closure problem. }

Minor points 

{\color{blue}
Track record, Reading. “Mesoscale Meteorology Group meetings” }

p.3, para 1: “the convective grey zone”. In para 2 you make a distinction between convective and turbulent grey zones, but this is not explained. In particular, I assume with the “turbulent grey zone” you are talking about partial resolution of BL eddies. Perhaps make a connection here? You are thinking primarily of a convective BL (driven by cooling aloft or surface heating) and therefore dry convection, as opposed to moist convection? It might be easier for reviewers to make the connection to multi-fluid in this BL regime (in contrast to stable BL with shear-driven turbulence). 

{\color{blue}
p.3: Is Thuburn et al (2018) the first paper to propose and formulate mathematically multi-fluid modelling of convection? 
Section 3 heading: perhaps “Formulation of multi-fluid modelling of convection”  }

{\color{blue}
p.5: probably not for the proposal case, but why formulate in terms of momentum and pressure rather than vorticity? }

{\color{blue}
Section 4 start: “This project will utilise and advance some ParaCon outcomes:” }

{\color{blue}
item 3: physical basis for maximising transport by the mean velocity of each fluid? }

Item 5: You have a little space to make the connection to Fig.1 and use it more effectively. What is the main point you are trying to get across? That 2-fluid solution is similar to the LES simulation? Connects back to point above. You are using the LES simulation as a nature run, or reference solution for evolution of the system studied, and therefore the fact that your 2-fluid simulation is similar is a positive result. Need to bring this across. Also, how close is good? For example, would a single-fluid simulation with parametrisation be much worse? 

Item 7: seems somewhat at odds with your earlier statement that multi-fluid models of convection have not yet been developed in 3-D. Here, you make it sound like you have already written the 3-D model with simplified moist physics. Your case actually seems stronger without item 7, or you need to make very clear what the limitations are of the model development so far. 

Section 5, Item c: “than a single-fluid with or without parameterization and …”? 

{\color{blue}
Item 2: using LES simulations as reference solutions }

{\color{blue}
Item 4: also unknown correlations between the fluids (not just the moments)? }

Summary of changes by JT

General wordsmithing to make the language more precise and to link ideas, hopefully improving the flow...

Removed ML.

Shortened JT's track record a bit and added an two introductory sentences about breadth of expertise.

Addressed some reviewers' comments.

I followed Dan's suggestion and replaced the `diffusion' terms by div of stress tensor and buoyancy flux, especially as the stress tensor should probably be symmetric and trace free.

Didn't manage to do anything with sections 6 - 8.


{\color{red}
Still to do

Check for variations on spelling of parameterise(d), etc.

Check that reference lists are correct - I might have removed or added some.
