Dr William McIntyre has been a PDRA on the Paracon project at Exeter since October 2020 where he has been working on multi-fluid modelling of convection and is writing up a paper on single-column modelling of moist convection. Will was officially awarded his PhD from Reading in October 2020 on Multifluid modelling of dry convection. In the 6 months preceding October, he also worked as a Research Assisstant on single- and multi-column multi-fluid dry convection modelling. His work on numerical methods will enable some of the outcomes of this project (McIntyre et al., 2020). In 2018, Will was a prize winner for his talk at the Department of Meteorology's annual Quo Vadis event, and subsequently gave a talk for the Royal Meteorological Society as an invited speaker.
